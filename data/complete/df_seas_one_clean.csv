If I was in this situation I would feel like I was important and that the work I did matters. I would feel like I was a part of the team and that my time at the company is useful.","As I mentioned before employee's should be praised for the job well done. In this case the task that the employee was assigned would make the boss feel happy because he doesn't need to go back and edit the work. It doesn't add an extra workload to the boss which results in why he congratulates the employee with a job well done.","In this moment I would feel like a failure. Especially if the task I was assigned was something that I put a lot of time and effort into it. No one ever wants to receive the news that the job was done poorly. If it was something that I had only invested partial or no time at all in it then I wouldn't feel as bad because I would have expected it.","Depending on what the task was my boss may feel a bit of frustration and anger because he might have to push back deadlines or complete the task himself in order to meet the deadline. It is also possible that the task done poorly may affect a customer's visit to the job location and your boss will have to put other tasks aside in order to fix the job the employee failed to do effectively.","In this case I would feel sadness and frustration. I would feel sad because if the project was something really dear to me then I would want to see it through. However, my business partner calls to tell me that in the end it would not happen which would end up crushing my heart. I would also feel frustration because it takes a lot of time, effort, and money to plan a trip and if we're already talking finances and have already invested money then we would have lost so much at such an early stage.","There a re two ways my friend could feel and it all depends on how their personality is. They could feel no remorse at all. Meaning this could have been their possible intention to leave me high and dry or maybe they were just humoring me and my business idea. Then my friend could also feel regret, or embarrassment. They would feel this because they are my friend they hate to disappoint me or make it seem like they aren't just as dedicated.","I would feel an array of emotions. At first I would feel a bit betrayed because I didn't know this key piece of information, however; this emotion would quickly pass and then I would feel a wave of understanding come over me. I would put myself in his shoes and realize that the reason he didn't tell me is a very valid one. Lastly, I would be happy that he even decided to tell me in the end and that he trusted me enough to tell me.","At first he would feel very anxious because he doesn't tell many people about his secret wealth since he considers it his family's wealth.

The boss could be feeling a range of things but I think they would most likely be annoyed at the situation, angry that I didn't do my best work, or sad that they are potentially hurting my feelings.","I would initially feel annoyed by their inconsistency and disappointed if it were something I was excited and confident about. After having some time to process the situation, I would come back down to earth and remind myself that I have no control over what another person decides to do, and just because someone didn't do what I wanted does not mean that they are wrong in their decision.","As a friend to many, I can confidently say that my friend would feel apologetic and guilt-ridden more than anything. With this situation, I would imagine my friend feeling a whirlwind of distress- nervousness and anxiety more than anything, but also fear that the friendship would change or be polluted with the heaviness of the situation.","How I feel depends on the length and seriousness of the relationship. As a general statement regardless of the time frame, I would feel that he/she not wanting it known is silly and invalid because that money belongs to the family, not them. However, if we were at the point where we were discussing marriage and they kept a ""secret"" like that, I would be hurt and agitated and feel as though they didn't trust me or had doubts.","It sounds as if she/he would feel worried.

Given how much effort the project would have likely taken (this assumption is based off the amount of time allotted to it; “several months”), I would probably be fairly, involuntarily, emotionally invested in the effort it took to produce my work.

They may also feel let down/left “holding the bag,” because they likely also would have to answer to Their boss about how my project went.","If my friend and I had negotiated to start a business venture, knowing me (and my friends), this endeavor would have been thoroughly hashed out, risks examined, expenditures calculated, etc. In other words, this would have been deeply considered prior to entering any agreements. If my friend suddenly withdrew from it, I would be taken aback and curious as to what changed their mind. I would not be angry, seeing as I would give my friend the benefit of the doubt and run with the assumption that they realized there was some imminent, not previously considered risk present, and that the venture wasn’t a wise business decision. The only thing I would potentially be a bit annoyed over would be the fact that I found this information out after calling Them. If they came to this decision, they should have let me know quickly thereafter so that I wouldn’t possibly begin moving forward in business plans while I’m thinking I still have a business partner right there with me.","I would assume my friend would feel a bit guilty (and that’s why they didn’t call me right away after definitively making the decision to withdraw from the deal), and that they also would have good reason for making the decision they did.","I would understand why this person didn’t tell me about their extreme wealth, but I would also be a bit surprised. The reason for the surprise is because if we are discussing marriage, chances are I’ve been with this person a significant amount of time, and in a serious, stable enough relationship to even begin contemplating something as serious as marriage. Based off that, they should know me well enough at this point to know I am not the type who would be with them for their money. Particularly considering the fact that I have been dating them all this time with the understanding that their financial situation was not so good. Due to this, there shouldn’t have been any doubt surrounding my decency, so why the secret was kept for so long would actually make me concerned/confused.","My partner would maybe feel (in this situation I’m less certain how the other person would feel in this situation vs. how I felt others would feel in situations prior) relief after sharing their secret, and hopefully also empathy and understanding for my upset and confusion regarding my assessment of how they have judged my character.","4 = quite a bit","1 = very slightly or not at all","3 = moderately","2 = a little","3 = moderately","1 = very slightly or not at all","1 = very slightly or not at all","1 = very slightly or not at all","4 = quite a bit","2 = a little","2 = a little","3 = moderately","1 = very slightly or not at all","4 = quite a bit","1 = very slightly or not at all","4 = quite a bit","4 = quite a bit","1 = very slightly or not at all","3 = moderately","1 = very slightly or not at all","3","3","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","3","3","3"

I also would  feel motivated to do better and improve myself and help even more in anyway that i can. I may, depending on how important the task was to me, get taken over by a feeling of elation, like i am floating, and cry happy tears. I would feel very good about myself in that moment and have more confidence in my abilities and potential and that practice makes perfect and try not to let little hick-ups along the way discourage me from striving toward the bigger picture.","He/she would feel like they can have trust and confidence in my abilities. They would feel like they can hand me bigger, more important tasks and have higher standard for my work, which in turn may make them be harder on me and my performance. They would feel like i have much undiscovered potential and would respect my opinion and knowledge.","I would initially feel rejected, but soon after i would feel like i can improve my work and would ask for my errors on my work and how i can fix them. I would feel like maybe I didn’t understand the directions clearly or misinterpreted them, so i would try to take a different  approach if need be. I would feel like i need to prove myself more to show my real potential and wouldn’t want them to think of me as incompetent because i feel like i am good at learning and i am curious and it is important to me that people in certain areas of my life know that.","They would feel that i am not up for the task and that I am not ready. They would feel that i am incompetent and cant count on me for important things. They would feel like i dont belong with the smarter people in the office. They would feel like they dont need to give me another chance and would just use me for ordinary daily tasks that anyone could get done, as opposed to the important tasks that fall under the bigger picture and the purpose behind the system as a whole and its design.","I would feel that my friend doesn’t trust me and/or the investment opportunity. I would feel that maybe i need to do more research and would discuss with them their concerns and then try to either provide accurate explanation and knowledge as to why they are wrong or would agree with them.","They would feel like they cant trust me or the investment. They feel like we haven’t done enough research to complete the investment and need to either acquire more information or change directions in where are are investing.","I would feel different and contradictory emotions all at once, so i would have to sit down and carefully analyze each of them to find which scenario is more probable based on my idea of his character. Depending on my strongest impression of him and the trust established between us, I woud have an initial feeling or intuition, which could also be out of fear and hence, negative, intense, and inaccurate. These feelings wouldn’t typically be in any specific order, unless his reaction and/or approach signals a red flag that would be concerning to me. When he discloses the truth about his wealth, I would feel like he has a mistrust toward romantic partners in regards to money and that he has had bad past experiences with them with respect to his wealth. I would feel like I need to discuss the reason with him for better insight in regards to his reason to see if there’s an underlying or deeper issue that needs to be addressed. I might also feel jealous with a hint of anger that he used to date the type of girls who go after a guy’s money, which drastically deviates from my morals, and would reevaluate his preferences in choosing a partner. I would maybe feel a little disappointed that he didn’t use his financial means to show/do things for me that he typically would want to do for his romantic partner and feel as though i was deprived of his full and honest love. However, I would quickly get over that feeling especially if he reassures me that his intention was not to deceive me, and if we have had rich and quality experiences together regardless of his financial adversities in the relationship. I could would feel mistrust toward him in the long run that he might just keep things from me, especially important things, and keep me in the dark. Since dishonesty is a deal-breaker for me, i would try to give him a chance to earn back my trust, while i continue to remain suspicious of his intentions for some time following the incident. I could also feel that, in a completely different way, he has pure intentions and wants a partner who can accept him for who he is with all of his imperfections, and wants to make sure that his wealth is not a primary influence on his partner’s love for him, which would encourage me to have sympathy for him develope a different kind of respect toward him.","He would feel uneasy disclosing this matter at first and maybe even be hesitant. Once he does, he would feel uncertain of my internal feelings and thoughts about it and would want me to express how i feel openly. He may also remain uncertain as to why i chose to forgive him, and whether or not his wealth had a roll to play in my decision. Depending on his idea of my character and his security in both our relationship and within himself, he will choose to believe whether his fear is valid, or that it is inaccurate and decide that it may not even be significant and/or indicative of ill intentions. If he is trusting of my love, he will start to live his life normally and include me in it without factoring in concerns about his wealth. Depending on my initial reaction and handling of my feelings toward him, though, he may grow fearful of telling me the truth about other things, and start to be less vulnerable, resulting in withdrawals emotionally and intimately.","3 = moderately","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","2 = a little","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","4 = quite a bit","2 = a little","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","4 = quite a bit","5 = extremely","4 = quite a bit","4 = quite a bit","5 = extremely","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","1 = very slightly or not at all","4 = quite a bit","3","3","2","4 = I'm always good at this","3","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","3","2","2"

I wouldn't be able to stop smiling, and depending on what type of project it was, for example, doing something that I have never done before or I have struggled with in the past, I would feel relieved that I am doing a good job. Also, I would secretly be very flattered, though I would try my best to keep a calm and cool demeanor in front of my boss, though as I really quiet person who keeps to herself, those who are close to me would know I would be happy as I would express my feelings around them.","How my boss would feel might depend on the context. On one hand, if my boss simply wanted his employees to get the job done and if my coworkers weren't very hardworking in general, then telling me that my work is excellent may just be a sign that they are relieved that I got the job done. On the other hand, if my boss doesn't really compliment others and the environment is competitive, I think that they really do feel impressed and in awe that I could do such a good job that they felt compelled to tell me. They might even be surprised if this is the first project that I have ever worked on under their supervision.","While I would try to keep a straight face in front of my boss and keep the mentality that I should listen to the criticism and use that to improve my work, I would feel a combination of negative emotions that would well up in me until I find myself in a private place where I can ruminate on their comments. I would definitely feel hurt and disappointed in myself. I would start to get insecure about my skills and become worried for the future (will I be unsuccessful? will I be fired?), and if I was really as hard working as I could be, I would be confused as if to what I'm doing wrong. I would also get frustrated not only at myself, but also at my boss, maybe my coworkers if they were involved, maybe try to blame factors outside of work, or simply be angry at life. Then, I would try to numb my emotions a day after that passes to get work done, though that comment will always be like a pinch at the back of my head for a while.","I think my boss would be very disappointed and me and frustrated that I'm missing the mark. They might be angry as well because I'm not pleasing them or meeting their standards.","I don't know a lot about business or investing of the sorts so this might influence my responses. I'm not sure if that means that we'll get our money back or if one person is going to keep the money invested, but either way, knowing investing is a big deal financially, I would definitely feel anger and disappointment and would let them know too, rather than keeping my emotions to myself. I would probably feel angry towards them and if they're keeping the money, I would think they were greedy and we would definitely not be friends anymore. I would also feel disappointed and upset because I had invested in something important to me, and now I'm not getting what I should. Now, if we'd only agreed and I hadn't done anything with my money yet, I probably would only feel disappointed that I was let down and that something I was looking forward is canceled. Before I'd let all of this emotion get to me however, I would definitely ask my friend questions about why they changed their mind before I come to conclusions.","Whether they are a friend that changes their mind because of malicious intent or not, I think they would definitely feel uncomfortable when they tell me they changed their mind, unless they are so malicious that they could do so nonchalantly. If my friend truly didn't mean to hurt me, they probably feel a lot of regret and worry about my reaction to their answer.","This is a really complex question to answer, because I think this situation can be explained in different ways and my feelings would depend on certain details. First of all, I believe that if I am in love, I wouldn't care if a person came from a poor or rich family, if what they did for a living earned them six figures or not a year. I would definitely understand where he would be coming from; growing up, I didn't want people to know I usually made good grades so that people wouldn't just befriend me for homework answers. That same way of thinking would apply to his situation and I would definitely empathize with him and his feelings. However, not telling me he was from a wealthy family is still kind of a lie in my eyes - but depending on if he simply concealed that info from me or acted in front of me in such a way that he deliberately wanted to appear poor actually matters a lot. Using the metaphor of my grades in high school, I never outright told other people that I made straight A's, but I never lied by saying that I couldn't figure stuff out; in his case, he would've never told me that he was from a wealthy family, but he didn't deliberately act as if he was poor. I would think to myself different questions trying to connect the dots with his past behavior, such as: ""Did he really wear these type of clothes because he loves dressing comfortably, or does he do this to appear a certain way?"" ""How much did he lie about his childhood?"" If he was simply subtly concealing his wealth and I just happened to assume he wasn't well financially, then we would probably still be okay as a couple. However, if him concealing his wealth really influenced a large part of his actions and personality, then I think I would be quite upset the more I think about the revelation. This is because is would've been essentially lying about himself - I would be in love with a lie. And ironically, despite the fact that he was looking for ""genuine love,"" he himself wasn't genuine at all, and depending on if certain actions were performed and to the extent he tried to put on a façade, I would definitely think he was being selfish trying to change himself for me and I would end the relationship. Hopefully, it would be the former situation and not the latter. For the former, I would simply reassure him that I don't care about money and would simply be curious about his family, like I would with any other relationship.","They might feel scared or nervous that I might reject them or get upset because they've lied/haven't told the truth about their family, and that I might get intimidated by his wealth. However, another part of me feels that if they truly love me and know me for who I am, they would also feel relieved and comfortable in telling me the truth about their background because they know I would still accept them.","4 = quite a bit","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","2 = a little","2 = a little","2 = a little","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","2","2","3","4 = I'm always good at this","3","3","4 = I'm always good at this","3","4 = I'm always good at this","3","2","3","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this"

I would get very prideful and feel the need to tell anyone and everyone I can. It's not necessarily to brag but rather to feel warm and gooey inside reliving the moment over and over in multiple conversations throughout the day. I would feel more accomplished than most people because I struggle with self confidence so when I receive praise, I like to really bask in it. I believe that some people would feel the same as me if not more, however the majority, in my opinion, would feel good and move on to their next task.","If my boss is the one giving praise then something very good must have been done on my part. When I give praise to my friends, I feel proud when I see their happiness. I can only assume that the boss felt a high level of pride and happiness toward their employee.","I would immediately feel the need to prove myself. I cannot stand being looked down on or having people think of me in any negative way. I have a lot of problems with self confidence and insecurities. If I am told that my work is horrible, I feel as though I would go to a lower internal place than other people. If I do something wrong (in my eyes), I punish myself mentally and go to a really bad place within myself. I would wallow for some time and then push myself back up in order to get out of that place. I always get out of my funk no matter how long it takes, and once I do, I push back harder. I crave attention and love so I do whatever I can to reach it.","I think my boss would feel some sense of repulsion and disappointment. ""Unacceptable"" is a very harsh, extreme criticism so in order for ""unacceptable"" and ""needs to be improved"" to be said, I feel as though I must have done something completely wrong. I sometimes feel as though peoples emotions and feelings are always justified, meaning there is always a reason behind every human interaction, both physical and emotional. So if my boss was that heavily upset with me, I couldn't think of it as being a wrong or inaccurate feeling towards me but rather I MUST have done something wrong and I HAVE to fix it.","I don't think I would feel too upset. I am very hesitant when it comes to money and investing, so I probably would not have been 100% ready to go through with the business deal. Whenever friends back out of any kind of plans or deals, I never get too upset with them since I tend to make excuses for those around me. Internally, I'm contemplating wether they don't want to hang out with me, don't trust me with the deal, have something better as an option elsewhere, etc.. I would destroy my mind worrying about WHY. I wouldn't be upset about the business venture falling through but rather why did my friend pull out.","Since I am in constant paranoia about what my friends think regarding me at all times, it is hard for me to imagine what my friend would feel when backing out since I would personally believe a plethora of reasons why. If it was genuine then I do think my friend would express regret and sadness for letting me down but I feel as though (personally) I would misinterpret. Knowing my friends, however, I know deep down inside that if it was nerves that come with making money investments, they would tell me very open and honestly because if you really know me, you know that I am extremely skeptical of money investments.","I would never consider something like that a ""lie"". Many people would try to take advantage of that person so in order to find a true and genuine relationship, that person would need to protect themselves from untrue people. If we were struggling beyond believe and I was trying my hardest to keep up afloat, then I would feel a small sense of betrayal since I would be working myself to death only to find out that there was a small escape. I feel as though not telling your s/o about something that could make them take advantage of you at the beginning of a relationship is totally rational since their protecting themselves emotionally. If my income was adequate and this person was intelligent, I feel as though I would be happy regardless of their money/stature. I value the intellect and meaningful conversations in a shabby apartment rather than the bliss of ignorance in a million dollar mansion.","If my partner truly loved me and was only trying to protect himself from the greed and malice of other people, I think that they would feel a strong love for me in order to be able to free themselves from the guilt of not being true about who they are. It is a big burden to bear to hide something as significant as money and wealth. It must be on the tip of their tongue every second to come clean once they realise that their partner is truly in love for the person they are and not their materialistic counterpart. I think they would feel an immense sense of relief to be able to show who they really are. It isn't a lie to with hold information (in my eyes). I would want my partner to be able to fully love and trust in me and I would feel blessed for them to be able to share something like that with me. It would show me that that person is real towards me.","5 = extremely","3 = moderately","5 = extremely","2 = a little","5 = extremely","2 = a little","3 = moderately","1 = very slightly or not at all","5 = extremely","5 = extremely","2 = a little","5 = extremely","3 = moderately","5 = extremely","3 = moderately","5 = extremely","5 = extremely","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","2 = a little","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","3","3","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","2","3","3"

Long projects are difficult for me especially when It come to staying focused on a long term goal and the fear of failure often time prevents me from getting work done so a project over months would be very difficult. After the initial feeling of relief that I had met expectations and I would get to keep my job (assuming I would be fired if my work was not excellent) I would secondly feel proud of myself for growing in my career and pushing myself to do the project and I would feel like a celebration was in store after leaving work for the day.","My boss would feel proud of themselves and their team including myself. My boss would probably pride his/her self for hiring an employee that did excellent work and probably attribute some of the projects success to themselves and their management skills. They would also feel relieved they no longer have to oversee the long project and be excited to come up with whatever work would come next. My boss would also feel exhausted after having to convey what they wanted for the project in such a specific way over a long period of time making sure I did an excelent job. And even after my part was done my boss still had to take days to review the project after submitting it and they're probably glad its over with.","I would feel crushed, a job is a big part of my life and I relate my job performance and work ethic as a core component of my personality because I pride myself on always working on something productive and producing great work. In addition I would feel almost betrayed by my boss for not seeing the effort I put in and rather than helping me to do a better job they just told me it was unacceptable. I would be stressed about the possibility of losing my job and being unable to pay bills. I would feel Isolated assuming my coworkers didn't like me because no one likes a co-worker that cant pull their weight. I want to say I would feel motivated to do better but I don't think this comment would motivate me it would make me sad and feel like I lacked value in the workplace.","My boss would feel frustrated because running a company with an employee that isn't pulling their weight makes it much harder to handle. They have a lot on their plate already and most likely already feel overwhelmed. They may also feel nervous to confront me about my poor performance out of fear I will not listen to them or take them seriously. They may also feel sad about having to tell me my work needs improvement because they like me as a person but cant let that get in the way of executing their job. Feelings of stress would probably dominate my boss though because they may need to do additional paperwork documenting my poor performance. This added time spent on the job acts as yet another stressor for my boss.","I would feel dissopointed that our idea would not be able to come to life but I wouldn't hold it against my friend, its a big undertaking and it had been several days but in the grand scheme of things that is not that long and maybe they should've taken longer to think about the idea.","my friend would feel guilty, regretful and stressed to tell me the news and that's likely why they hadn't called me first. The friend has to deal with their own dissopointment that the idea wont manifest but they also carry the weight of having to let a close friend down unknowing how I would react. The friend probably feels guilty for making the best move for themselves because it was at the expense of another person.","I feel blindsided and hurt on the deepest level. Someones financial upbringing has a lot to do with their development and their story as a person and to lie or omit the truth about something a fundemntal as family would be mind boggling. It doesn't matter that my income was adequate and they didn't contribute im upset about being lied to only to find out when discussing a forever commitment. I feel sad knowing the version of someone I fell in love with is not the person im discussing marriage with. I'm questioning this persons honesty in every aspect, what else don't I know? or what would they keep from me in the future? Was I blinded by their attractiveness and intelligence that I was blind to the lies and manupliation. For a moment I can put myself in his/her shoes and understand not wanting someone to love you for your money but this could've been disclosed after the first time saying ""I love you"" or even before. Waiting until now was selfish of that person and I feel like it has tainted my love for this person.","He/ she would likely feel overwhelming stress and guilt mixed with regret and despair. They likely know waiting until now was a mistake and this is a secrete that could potentially cause much animosity and ruin the relationship. This person probably feels torn because their honest attempt to guard their heart in the beginning of the relationship could be the very thing that puts them in a position to be hurt the worst. This person is likely ready to ""fix"" this with their money and buy back the other persons love and apologize. I have to believe this person thinks this conversation will go well or they would've brought it up sooner, unless there were mortified they would lie about something so fundamental.","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","2 = a little","3 = moderately","5 = extremely","5 = extremely","4 = quite a bit","1 = very slightly or not at all","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","2 = a little","5 = extremely","1 = very slightly or not at all","3 = moderately","5 = extremely","3 = moderately","2 = a little","5 = extremely","4 = quite a bit","1 = very slightly or not at all","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","1 = I'm always poor at this","1 = I'm always poor at this","1 = I'm always poor at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","2","1 = I'm always poor at this","1 = I'm always poor at this","4 = I'm always good at this","3","4 = I'm always good at this"

Since my boss took the time out of their day to stop by and comment on my work, I'd like to think that my boss is paying attention and keeping a close eye on me and possibly other employees regarding our tasks in the work place. I believe that is a good trait to have as a person in a higher position because caring about employees and their progress is important in the long run for any company and contributes to its overall success. In essence, I'd feel successful in what I'm doing at work and this situation will motivate me to continue my efforts on future projects as I could potentially get promoted and obtain a salary increase.","I believe that my boss would feel proud in what I am accomplishing and contributing in the workplace. If my boss notices on how I am accomplishing projects and takes the time to tell me that my work was excellent, that would make him appear to be very attentive to me and possibly other employees. In addition, my boss would feel a sense of satisfaction that an employee is being highly regarded for their outstanding performance and high achieving accomplishments. This in turn, would make my boss take a mental note that I am an employee they could rely on in the future to help further the success of the company or business. If I continue my excellent work in projects, my boss would feel the need to put me in a high pedestal and could potentially give me a promotion or raise based on a repeating amount of noticeable hard work and success in projects.","I would feel disheartened, disappointed, and pathetic to hear that my boss doesn't like my work especially because I've put in all my effort, time, and hard work into it. In a way, this would cause me more stress and pressure to change what I'm doing to satisfy their standards. In that moment, I'd feel a wave of sadness loom over me for the rest of the day and possibly the rest of the week because I'll be trying to think about what was wrong with my project. I'd become my own critic until my boss finally accepts my work, but at the same time I'd feel very self-conscious of myself and develop a mentality that my boss can replace me with someone else who has better potential for the company. This negative comment from my boss would impact my personal life as well because I'll be considering this on a daily basis and overthinking different scenarios that could happen if my boss doesn't like my revised work or submitted work in the future.","My boss would be disappointed in me as an employee of the workplace. Having to tell an employee that their work is unacceptable means that they did not succeed in their given task. My boss would also feel stressed because an employee isn't getting their work done in an efficient manner and they'd also have to worry about my tasks when they could be putting their energy into other important duties. Because of this negative experience, my boss would keep a close eye on me to see whether I have improved or maintained the same level of unsuccessful attempts. If my boss continues to notice that I didn't improve, he could possibly fire me or demote from my current position. In addition, he would see me as an unreliable employee.  However, if my boss notices improvement, he could see that I'm putting in a great amount of effort to satisfy the given task and successfully fix my mistakes from previous projects.","I wouldn't think too much of my friend's decision to change their mind because I'm accustomed to people being unable to maintain a fixed plan. I believe that my friend could possibly be thinking of a better plan for the new business venture, taking the time to decide whether investing money would be a good idea, or figuring out that they do not meet the financial means to take their own money for investment. I consider myself an understandable person so if the plan doesn't work out, I wouldn't feel disappointed or disheartened unless I was extremely passionate about it. Otherwise, our plan wasn't able to take off and I could do other things with my time other than blame and hold a grudge against my friend for their change in mind.","My friend could possibly feel like they let me down and disappointed me for not keeping the potentially successful business plan. They could also shy away from me and feel like an embarrassment due to their change in mind which in turn, could create a sense of nervousness when they approach me through the phone. If my friend was very sensible to their actions, they would be hesitant to make future plans with me because of their experience with this situation.","I would feel a sense of relief in knowing that they consider me as someone who isn't out to get them for their money. I'd also feel as if we've establish a sense of trust in our relationship that exceeds on a different level because they not only shared their personal information with me, but also their financial circumstances. I find it reasonable to be modest with wealth especially in certain cultures where people, even family members, envy and exploit those who they see as ""wealthy."" On the other hand, I'd also be relieved that my significant other could potentially inherit a sum of money for themselves and that they wouldn't have to rely on me in the future for financial gains. I'd be understanding of this situation in general and won't be spiteful that my partner fooled me into thinking that they were not financially well off because they have their reasons.","They would feel embarrassed that they have to hide the fact that they come from an extremely wealthy family and maybe even hesitant to tell me beforehand because of possible situations in the past where someone has attempted to or tried to use them for money. However, they would feel trustful in telling me something personal that they don't tell other people. My partner could also feel nervous in what my reaction will be when they tell me this and could possibly see it as a situation where I'm upset that they've hidden something from me for a while.","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","2 = a little","3 = moderately","2 = a little","1 = very slightly or not at all","1 = very slightly or not at all","2 = a little","1 = very slightly or not at all","1 = very slightly or not at all","4 = quite a bit","4 = quite a bit","2 = a little","1 = very slightly or not at all","2 = a little","3 = moderately","4 = quite a bit","1 = very slightly or not at all","2 = a little","1 = very slightly or not at all","3","3","2","1 = I'm always poor at this","2","2","3","3","3","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","2","3","2"

However, if my boss was someone who is generally lighthearted, then the comment would've been questionable, and I would tend to think that my boss just wanted to say my project is excellent to make me feel better about all of my hard work.","I would be disheartened as he would be quickly and easily tell me that the months of work that I have sacrificed was for nothing, and I would urge him or her to give me crucial feedback. I would be quick to think about the possibilities of error that I made in the project so I can discuss it with him or her.","Also depends on the nature of my boss, whether he or she is strict and serious or lighthearted. If he or she tends to be strict and serious, I would have expected some sort critique, and I would expect him to feel upset with me but it would not be a big deal because he or she tends to be that way in general. If he or she is more lighthearted then it would be serious; he or she would be more upset and tend to think about becoming more strict and serious with me.","I would be upset but I would ask her/ him as to why he has changed his or her mind and attempt to develop an understanding. If he or she has a valid reason then I would be fine with it.","My friend would most likely feel upset due to his or her lack of promise, but knows that if he or she explains herself then it would not be much of a problem and we would continue to be good friends.","I would question why he would wait this long to tell me, I would be concerned with the fact that he couldn't trust me enough and also question my own ability to show him who I really am. However, eventually, I feel as though I'd develop some sort of understanding as to his intentions and not entirely accuse him of not trusting me because everybody is human and if my significant other wanted to keep these matters to himself then that is fine, as I'm pretty sure that I would be reluctant to tell others as well if I was in his shoes.","I would assume that he would either feel guilty or slightly proud that he was able to find someone to tell.

I guess depressing thoughts is the best way to put it (you're not good enough,you will never be good enough, etc.) however I would never go as far as to physically hurt myself!

If the tone was more ""try to fix your work and improve"" (positive), I would try to see what I did wrong, try to fix it, and learn from the experience. I would eventually do this once I'm able to clear my head in the ""Negative"" case in the paragraph above too.","Depends on how my boss is:

If they are just done with my work ability (negative) then they would be furious and would probably throw a few insults or even fire me.

If they are trying to be encouraging that I need to improve (Positive) then they would be more understanding and calm in the situation and be willing to help explain to me what I did wrong so I know how to fix it.","I would be angry at first. It is hard for me to give my trust to anyone and all of my friends are close ones, so for a friend to do that would make me very angry, but I wouldn't let that emotion to control my judgement or how I would treat my friend because their would be a reason behind this change and if it was a few days before a payment then I would be fine with trying to get it changed and move on, still being friends.","My friend would probably be very embarrassed and wouldn't have wanted to make the call in the first place to tell me. Any friends I have are like family to me and they know it so calling would have been hard on them, but they should know that I wouldn't be very angry, especially not for long.","I would be in understanding for their motives and wouldn't worry to much about it. If it is someone I love, then money is not important. Family is more important to me than money will ever be.","They would most likely feel embarrassed and afraid to tell me at first, but after talking with them, explaining that I don't care about the money, they would be happy.","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","2 = a little","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","1 = very slightly or not at all","2 = a little","2 = a little","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","2 = a little","5 = extremely","1 = very slightly or not at all","4 = quite a bit","4 = quite a bit","3 = moderately","3 = moderately","2 = a little","1 = very slightly or not at all","2 = a little","3","1 = I'm always poor at this","4 = I'm always good at this","2","2","3","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","4 = I'm always good at this","2","1 = I'm always poor at this","1 = I'm always poor at this","3","3","3"

I would not be upset that they did not mention they were from a wealthy family like that depending on how long I've been with them. I would appreciate it if they told me something that big, but at the same time, they could have a poor relationship with their family.
