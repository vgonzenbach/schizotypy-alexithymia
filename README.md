# Examining the multidimensional relationship between dimensions of schizotypy and alexithymic deficits

This project examines the multidimensional relationship between schizophrenia-related cognitive and behavioral features (i.e. schizotypy) and the cognitive and affective processes underlying alexithymic deficits.

+ The main results are presented as a [poster](results/Gonzenbach_MS_2020.pdf). 
+ Pdf articles are included to provide background for the poster. They can be found in this [folder](ref/articles), with the corresponding [bibliography](ref/README.md).
+ [The detailed analysis report](results/internal/linear_models.pdf), and the [computational notebook](notebooks/linear_models/notebook.Rmd) that generated it are also included in this repository.
+ The code that generated the regression tables can be found [here](src/make_regression_tables.R).
